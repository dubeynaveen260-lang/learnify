# Learnify Transformation Summary

## Project Overview

We've successfully transformed the Learnify website from a single-page application with overlapping sidebar issues into a modern, multi-page web application inspired by Qoder.com. The new design maintains all existing features while significantly improving layout, navigation, and visual design.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Multi-Page Architecture
- Converted the single-page app into a proper multi-page Next.js application
- Each section now has its own dedicated page with clean URLs:

  - Course Roadmap (`/roadmap`)
  - Resources (`/resources`)
  - AI Assistant (`/ai-assistant`)
  - Quizzes (`/quizzes`)
  - Leaderboard (`/leaderboard`)
  - Community (`/community`)
  - Achievements (`/achievements`)
  - CGPA Calculator (`/cgpa-calculator`)

### 2. Modern Navigation System

### 4. Mobile Optimization
- Fully responsive design that works on all device sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements (minimum 44×44px tap targets)
- Proper viewport handling to prevent horizontal scrolling
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

### 5. Performance Improvements
- Code splitting with Next.js for faster loading
